                    <p class="text-22">In many households, an oven is frequently used to prepare delicious baked meals and, of course, delectable desserts! It is a quick and convenient method of cooking that lots of homeowners are in favour of as opposed to slaving over a hot stove. In fact, many working individuals buy oven-ready meals that provide a well-cooked meal in no time! Unfortunately, the overuse of one’s oven can leave the interiors in a terrible mess and promote bacteria buildup. Furthermore, a dirty oven can hinder the overall performance of the appliance, leaving you to pay costly repair bills every once in a while.<br>

                        With a continued influx of bookings through NDIS Plan Managers, and having worked for several individuals with disabilities across Sydney, our cleaners have proven to be some of the most compassionate and respectful professionals who excel in their field of work. Our extensive experience in assisting elderly clients and looking after their cleaning needs is yet another reason why we are a preferred cleaning agency among competitors.<br>

            <p>
                If you are acquiring our NDIS Cleaning Services through a Plan Manager, they will require a copy of the Service Agreement that is drafted upon discussing the participant’s specific NDIS cleaning needs. This Service Agreement must be currently active so that we have the all-clear to provide the required service, and for the Plan Manager to proceed with their handling of the NDIS funding for you. Along with a few basic details, we will need a verified email address to invoice the Plan Manager at the end of the service which will be submitted (by the Plan Manager) to the NDIA. We are happy to share copies of invoices to the participant as well, thereby ensuring complete transparency between all parties involved.

            <p>
                For Agency-managed participants, we will guide you through every step of the process to make things easier for you. This includes customising the service, filling out and submitting the Submission Form to the NDIA, and booking the service with upfront pricing provided for the agency to process your NDIS funding.
                We are registered with the NDIA, and work with Agency-managed participants to draft a suitable Active Service Agreement that will enable them to use our NDIS Cleaning Services at the earliest possible. In working with Agencies, we can help participants go about the entire process more quickly and seamlessly.

                Our utmost respect for NDIS Support Workers and their continued efforts to help those living with disabilities has further motivated us to provide nothing short of the best, customised NDIS Cleaning Services in Australia.

Upon submission, they will credit the bank account on file with the amount paid for the service.
